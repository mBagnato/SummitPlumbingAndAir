            <h4 class="h1 blue weight text-center">Gas Ducted</h4>
            <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">Gas ducted heating is an excellent choice for homeowners who want a reliable and efficient 
              heating system for their home. One of the main benefits of gas ducted heating is that it provides
               even heating throughout the house. The warm air is distributed evenly through ducts and vents,
                ensuring that every room is comfortable. This is especially important in larger homes, where 
                other heating methods may struggle to provide consistent warmth throughout the entire space.

              Another advantage of gas ducted heating is that it is energy efficient. Natural gas is a relatively cheap fuel 
              source compared to electricity, which means that homeowners can save money on their heating bills. Additionally, 
              modern gas ducted heating systems have high energy efficiency ratings, which means that they use less gas to produce 
              the same amount of heat compared to older systems.</p>

            <h4 class="h1 blue weight text-center">Ducted Split</h4>
            <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">A ducted split system provides efficient and even heating and cooling throughout the 
              home, using a central unit to distribute conditioned air via ductwork. With discreet 
              installation, convenient control via a central thermostat, and long-term cost savings, 
              it is a great choice for homeowners who want a reliable and energy-efficient heating and 
              cooling system.</p>

            <h4 class="h1 blue weight text-center">Wall Furnace</h4>
            <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">A wall furnace is a space-saving and efficient heating system that uses natural gas or 
              propane to provide heat. With convenient control via a thermostat and long-term cost savings, 
              it is a great choice for homeowners who want a reliable and cost-effective heating system.</p>
