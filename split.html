                     They consist of an outdoor unit that connects to an indoor unit and offer the flexibility of running
                      ducts into various rooms without needing an individual unit for each one. Moreover, the cooling power 
                      of these systems is stronger than ductless split systems. However, they come with a higher purchase and 
                      installation cost, so it is important to factor in this expense when making a decision.</p>

                  <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">Ducted Split System is a type of air conditioning system that is designed
                     to cool large residential or commercial spaces. The system consists of an outdoor unit that is connected 
                     to an indoor unit, which is usually installed in the ceiling or under the floor. The indoor unit is then
                      connected to a network of ducts that run throughout the building, distributing cool air to different 
                      rooms or zones. This type of air conditioning system is ideal for those who want to cool multiple areas
                       or rooms at the same time, as it allows for individual temperature control and can be zoned to cool 
                       only certain areas when needed. Ducted split systems are also known for their energy efficiency and
                        quiet operation, making them a popular choice for many homeowners and businesses.</p>
      
                  <h4 class="h1 blue weight text-center">Wall Mount Split System</h4>
                  <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">Wall-mounted split system air conditioners are a popular cooling option 
                    for many homes and businesses. They consist of two units: the indoor unit, which is mounted high up on a 
                    wall inside the building, and the outdoor unit, which can be installed in a number of positions on,
                     alongside, or near an outside wall. These units are generally energy-efficient, quiet, and can be 
                     installed quickly by a professional. The wall-mounted design also allows for easy temperature control
                      in a single room, making them a convenient choice for smaller spaces. They are a great choice for those 
                      looking for an affordable, easy-to-install cooling option.</p>
      
                  <h4 class="h1 blue weight text-center">Multihead Split System</h4>
                  <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">Multihead split system air conditioners are an ideal option for those who
                     want to cool multiple areas of their home or business. These systems consist of a single outdoor unit that
                      connects to multiple indoor units, allowing for separate cooling zones. Multihead split systems are 
                      particularly useful for larger homes or offices that require different temperatures in different rooms.
                       They also tend to be more energy-efficient than traditional air conditioning systems, as you can 
                       control the temperature in each room independently. Additionally, multihead split systems are easy to
                        install and maintain, making them a popular choice for many homeowners and small business owners.</p>

                        <h4 class="h1 blue weight text-center">Cassette Split System</h4>
                        <p class="weight fs-5 text-center">Cassette split system air conditioners are a popular option for
                           large spaces such as offices, showrooms, galleries, and retail spaces. They are installed in the 
                           ceiling, making them a discreet and unobtrusive option that blends in with the space's architecture.
                            These systems offer efficient and consistent cooling, with the ability to create different zones 
                            for cooling different areas. Cassette air conditioners are known for being quiet and unobtrusive,
                             with low noise levels and minimal vibrations. They can also be controlled remotely with a variety 
                             of options, including mobile apps, voice commands, or wall-mounted controllers. Overall, cassette
                              split system air conditioners are a great option for those who prioritize efficiency, functionality,
                               and aesthetics in their cooling solutions.</p>
